This extension restyles the Zoom web client to a light mode for easier viewing and reading.
You can modify the colors in the extension popup or options pages.

I created this project for my Computer Science course on Access Technology. I hope this will
increase accessibility of the Zoom web client for those with conditions that make dark mode
difficult to read. There is also a report on the
[project website](http://students.washington.edu/sgbowen8/light-mode/). Happy Zooming!
